# Internal_Hackathon
This was a project developed in the transfiNITTe intra-NIT hackathon 2020. The aim of the project was to use image processing integrated 
with a web app to detect the features of cars entering the NIT Trichy campus and to detect suspicious vehicles so as to prevent untoward
incidents from happening within the campus. 
This repo contains the code for the backend of the web-app, developed using Django.
